<h3>2. Types of Personal Data Subject to Processing</h3>
<p>"Personal data" means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (the "Data Subject"). An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.</p>
<p>The personal data that may be processed includes browsing data, data provided voluntarily by the data subject and cookies.<p>

<h3>A. Browsing Data</h3>
<p>The computer systems and software used to run this website during normal operations acquire certain personal data whose transmission is implicit in the use of Internet communication protocols. This information is not collected in relationship to the users, but due to its inherent nature, such information could enable the users to be identified via processing and associations with data held by third parties. This category of data includes, for example, the IP addresses or domain names of the users' computers connecting to the website.</p>
<p>The data is used for the sole purpose of obtaining anonymous statistical information concerning the website's use and to monitor the website's proper operation. In certain cases, the data may be used to ascertain liability in a suspected computer crime directed against the website. Other than the aforementioned cases, data on web contacts will not be held beyond the time required to meet requests made of the website. Personal data will not be disclosed to third parties; if requested, however, such data must be made available to the Italian Postal and Communication Police Service, legal authorities and criminal investigation police.</p>

<h3>B. Data Provided Voluntarily by Users</h3>
<p>The optional, explicit and voluntary sending or transmission of e-mail and/or personal data to the addresses given on the website will entail the subsequent acquisition of the sender's email address (which is required to respond to requests), as well as any other personal data present in the e-mail. The provision of the information is voluntary, but refusal of such renders the user's request impossible. This data will only be transmitted to third parties if necessary to the process of responding to the inquiry. The data will not be shared with third parties for marketing or profiling purposes.</p>

<h3>C. Cookies and Similar Technologies</h3>
<p>Cookies and similar technologies are information stored on websites and apps on the users devices during their first visit to the site. Cookies and related technologies allow websites and apps to remember user actions and preferences (such as login data, the default language, display settings, etc.) so that they will  be available in the user's subsequent visits. These technologies are used to perform IT authentications, session monitoring and to store information about the activities of users who access a service.</p>

<p>The website www.eurac.edu uses "persistent cookies" (small text files that the website temporarily saves directly on the computer) that allow the website to remember, for example, the user's preferred language or to show other possible versions of the website.</p>

<p>This website uses also Google Analytics, a web-analytics service provided by Google Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses cookies that enable the analysis of website usage for the purpose of determining the attractiveness of the website and to improve its performance and content. The information that the cookie generates about usage of this website (including the IP address) is transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. On behalf of the operator of this site, Google uses this information to evaluate use of the website, compile reports about website activity and to continue to provide website-usage and internet-related services to the website operator. In addition, Google may transmit this information to third parties, and when doing so, is required by law and/or where such third parties process the information on behalf of Google and/or other web-analytics service providers. Under no circumstances, however, will the user's IP address be associated with other data from Google and/or other web-analytics service providers.</p>

<p>Users may decline the use of cookies by downloading and installing Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add on for the appropriate web browser.</p>

<p>The website may also use third-party cookies, which are cookies from sites or web servers other than this website that are used for purposes of such third parties. For example, "social plugins" such as Facebook, Twitter or Google+ may be present on webpages and are generated and integrated into the host's page by these sites. The most common use of social plugins is for sharing content on social networks. These plugins transmit cookies to and from all third-party sites. This information from "third parties" is governed by the corresponding regulations, which must be observed. For more information and details about the various types of cookies, their operation and features, see the website <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.</p>

<h3>D. WordPress</h3>
<p>WordPress is a CMS (Content Management System) for creating and managing personal blogs. Blog posts are staff of Eurac Research or authorised external authors. A blog is an online journal or informational website displaying information in reverse chronological order, with latest posts appearing first. It is a platform where a writer or group of writers share their views on a subject. Posts may be commented on by other users and the comments may also include the feedback by other users, allowing interesting discussions about the post's original content.</p>

<p>The data provided by the participants of the blog on registering is restricted to the e-mail address, which is required to receive notification of a post's publication. When posting a comment, the user must submit their first and last name, which may or may not be published together with the posted comment. The e-mail address is used exclusively for sending news of the site.</p>

<p>The opinions and comments posted by the users and the information and data they contain are used exclusively for the purpose of publication of the blog. In particular, no aggregation or registration in a separate database has been planned. Any processing of personal data undertaken for statistical purposes at a future date would be done anonymously.</p>

<p>While the dissemination of user's anagraphic data and the data visible in their posted comments may be attributable to the single user's initiative, we guarantee that no other submission or dissemination of the data is currently foreseen. In any case, the users may exercise their rights according to art. 15 ff. GDPR.</p>
