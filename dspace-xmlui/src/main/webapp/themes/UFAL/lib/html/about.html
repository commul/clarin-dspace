		<br/>
		<p>
			The ultimate objective of CLARIN ERIC, to which also the ERCC adheres, is to advance research in humanities and social sciences by giving researchers unified single sign-on access to a platform which integrates language-based resources and advanced tools at a European level. This shall be implemented by the construction and operation of a shared distributed infrastructure that aims at making language resources, technology and expertise available to the humanities and social sciences research communities at large.

		<h3 id="terms-of-service">Terms of Service</h3>
		<p>
        To achieve our mission statement, we set out some ground rules through the <a href="./terms-of-service">Terms of Service</a>. By accessing or using any kind of data or services provided by the Repository, you agree to abide by the Terms contained in the above mentioned document.
        </p>
        <p>
        Data in the Eurac Research CLARIN Centre (ERCC) repository are made available under the licence attached to the resources. In case there is no licence, data is made freely available for access, printing and download for the purposes of non-commercial research or private study.

        Users <strong>must</strong> acknowledge in any publication, the Deposited Work using a persistent identifier (see <a href="./cite">Citing Data</a>), its original author(s)/creator(s), and any publisher where applicable. Full items must not be harvested by robots except transiently for full-text indexing or citation analysis.

		<h3 id="about-repository">About the Repository</h3>
		<p>It is like a library for linguistic data and tools. This means, using it, you can</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Search for data and tools and easily download them.</li>
			<li>Deposit your data and be sure it is safely stored, everyone
				can find it, use it, and correctly cite it (giving you credit)</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 id="about-eurac">About Eurac Research and the Institute for Applied Linguistics</h3>
		<p>
		In South Tyrol, multilingualism involves geographic, institutional, social and personal aspects. The main aim of research at the Institute for Applied Linguistics (IAL) is to provide scientific answers to current issues of language and education policy as well as to economic and social questions at both the local and international level. Our activities are targeted towards applied research (carrying out research projects and networking), training and consulting (consulting services, monitoring, seminars) as well as dissemination (scientific publications, dictionaries, data bases, corpora). IAL is part of Eurac Research which was funded in 1992 to strengthen research in the South Tyrol area. Today almost 300 scientists from over 30 countries work here in a wide number of different research fields.

		<h3 id="about-contracts">License Agreement and Contracts</h3>
		<p>At the moment, ERCC distinguishes three types of contracts.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>For every deposit, before accepting the resources from the submitter/depositor, the submitter has to sign the so-called <a id="distribution-link" href="contract">"Distribution License Agreement"</a>, in which we describe our rights and duties and the submitter acknowledges that they have the right to submit the data and give us (the repository centre) the right to distribute the data on their behalf.</li>
			<li>Everyone who downloads data is bound by the licence assigned to the item - in order to download protected data, one has to be authenticated and needs to electronically sign the licence. A list of available licenses in our repository can be found <a href="licenses" id="available-licenses">here.</a></li>
			<li>For submitters, there is a possibility for setting custom licences to items during the submission workflow.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<br/>
	<div>
		<h3 id="about-ipr">Intellectual Property Rights</h3>
		<p>
All Intellectual Property Rights concerning the provided resources belong to the original creator. As mentioned in the section <a href="#about-contracts">License Agreement and Contracts</a>, we require the depositor of data to sign a Distribution License Agreement, which specifies that they have the right to submit the data and gives us (the repository centre) the right to distribute the data on their behalf. This means that depositors are solely responsible for taking care of IPR issues before publishing data by submitting them to us.
<br/>
Should anyone have a suspicion that any of the datasets in our repository violate Intellectual Property Rights, they should contact us immediately at our <a class="helpdesk-tolink" href="#">Help Desk</a>.
