		<br/>
		<p>
			The ultimate objective of CLARIN ERIC, to which also the ERCC adheres, is to advance research in humanities and social sciences by giving researchers unified single sign-on access to a platform which integrates language-based resources and advanced tools at a European level. This shall be implemented by the construction and operation of a shared distributed infrastructure that aims at making language resources, technology and expertise available to the humanities and social sciences research communities at large.

		<h3 id="terms-of-service">Terms of Service</h3>
		<p>
        To achieve our mission statement, we set out some ground rules through the <a href="./terms-of-service">Terms of Service</a>. By accessing or using any kind of data or services provided by the Repository, you agree to abide by the Terms contained in the above mentioned document.
        </p>
        <p>
        Data in the Eurac Research CLARIN Centre (ERCC) repository are made available under the licence attached to the resources. In case there is no licence, data is made freely available for access, printing and download for the purposes of non-commercial research or private study.

        Users <strong>must</strong> acknowledge in any publication, the Deposited Work using a persistent identifier (see <a href="./cite">Citing Data</a>), its original author(s)/creator(s), and any publisher where applicable. Full items must not be harvested by robots except transiently for full-text indexing or citation analysis. Full items must not be sold commercially unless explicitly granted by the attached licence without formal permission of the copyright holders.

		<h3 id="about-repository">About the Repository</h3>
		<p>It is like a library for linguistic data and tools. This means, using it, you can</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Search for data and tools and easily download them.</li>
			<li>Deposit your data and be sure it is safely stored, everyone
				can find it, use it, and correctly cite it (giving you credit)</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 id="about-eurac">About Eurac Research and the Institute for Applied Linguistics</h3>
		<p>
		In South Tyrol, multilingualism involves geographic, institutional, social and personal aspects. The main aim of research at the Institute for Applied Linguistics (IAL) is to provide scientific answers to current issues of language and education policy as well as to economic and social questions at both the local and international level. Our activities are targeted towards applied research (carrying out research projects and networking), training and consulting (consulting services, monitoring, seminars) as well as dissemination (scientific publications, dictionaries, data bases, corpora). IAL is part of Eurac Research which was funded in 1992 to strengthen research in the South Tyrol area. Today over 400 scientists from over 30 countries work here in a wide number of different research fields.

		<h3 id="about-contracts">License Agreement and Contracts</h3>
		<p>At the moment, ERCC distinguishes three types of contracts.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>For every deposit, before accepting the resources from the submitter/depositor, the submitter has to sign the so-called <a id="distribution-link" href="contract">"Distribution License Agreement"</a>, in which we describe our rights and duties and the submitter acknowledges that they have the right to submit the data and give us (the repository centre) the right to distribute the data on their behalf.</li>
			<li>Everyone who downloads data is bound by the licence assigned to the item - in order to download protected data, one has to be authenticated and needs to electronically sign the licence. A list of available licenses in our repository can be found <a href="licenses" id="available-licenses">here.</a></li>
			<li>For submitters, there is a possibility for setting custom licences to items during the submission workflow.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<br/>
	<div>
		<h3 id="about-ipr">Intellectual Property Rights</h3>
		<p>
All Intellectual Property Rights concerning the provided resources belong to the original creator. As mentioned in the section <a href="#about-contracts">License Agreement and Contracts</a>, we require the depositor of data to sign a Distribution License Agreement, which specifies that they have the right to submit the data and gives us (the repository centre) the right to distribute the data on their behalf. This means that depositors are solely responsible for taking care of IPR issues before publishing data by submitting them to us.
<br/>
Should anyone have a suspicion that any of the datasets in our repository violate Intellectual Property Rights, they should contact us immediately at our <a class="helpdesk-tolink" href="#">Help Desk</a>.

	<div>
		<h3 id="privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</h3>
		<p>Read our <a href="privacypolicy">Privacy Policy</a> in order to learn how we manage personal data collected by the ERCC repository and services. There also exists a special <a href="registration-privacypolicy">privacy policy for registered users</a>.
        </p>
	</div>
	<br/>

    <div>
		<h3 id="metadata-policy">Metadata Policy</h3>
		<p>
       Deposited content must be accompanied by <a href="metadata">sufficient metadata</a> describing its content, provenance and formats in order to support its preservation and dissemination. Metadata are freely accessible and are distributed in the public domain (under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/cc0">CC0</a>). However, we would like to be informed about commercial usage of metadata from the ERCC repository including a description of your use case at the <a class="helpdesk-tolink" href="#">Help Desk</a>.
        </p>

	<br/>

    <div>
		<h3 id="preservation-policy">Preservation Policy</h3>
		<p>
			The Eurac Research CLARIN Centre is committed to the long-term care of items deposited in its repository, to preserve the
			research and to help in keeping research replicable and strives to adopt the
			current best practice in digital preservation. See the <a href="#mission-statement">Mission Statement</a>.
			We follow best practice guidelines, standards and regulations set forth by CLARIN, OAIS and/or Eurac
			Research.
		</p>
		<p>
			In order to stay a reliable and trustworthy repository, we undergo periodical assessments by CLARIN ERIC<!-- and
			<a href="https://www.coretrustseal.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/LINDAT-CLARIN.pdf">CTS</a> (formerly DSA)-->.
		</p>
		<p>
			To fulfill the commitments, the repository ensures that datasets are ingested and distributed in
			accordance with their license (see <a href="#about-contracts">agreements and contracts</a>). Sometimes
			(for licenses that do not permit public access) this means only authorized users can access the dataset.
		</p>
		<p>
			The submission workflow as described in <a href="deposit">deposit</a> and the work of our editors ensures
			discoverability (by requiring accurate <a href="#metadata-policy">metadata</a>) via our search engine,
			externally through OAI-PMH  and in page metadata for certain web crawlers. Metadata are freely accessible.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are various automated procedures including fixity checks, to ensure integrity of the submitted
			datasets and completeness of metadata. On the
			system level we employ various on-site and off-site backup strategies and hardware monitoring. The
			datasets are accessible online.
		</p>
        <p>
			We view data and tools as primary research outputs, each submission receives a Persistent IDentifier for reference and
			the users are <a href="cite">guided to</a> use them. Changes in a dataset after it has been published are
			not permitted, new submission is required instead. The old and new submissions are linked through their
			metadata (see <a href="https://github.com/ufal/clarin-dspace/wiki/New-Version-Guide">new version
			guide</a> 	for more details).
		</p>
		<p>
			Through regular participation in CLARIN activities, Open Repositories and various other meetings, schools
			and conferences, the repository staff is informed of new developments in technologies and/or initiatives.
		</p>
		<p>
			The various export options offered by the repository system (DSpace) ensures that data and their metadata
			are not locked in and can be moved to a different repository system.
		</p>
		<p>
			The repository encourages the usage of specific file formats as recommended by CLARIN. The preferred file
			formats will change over time, in which case the repository will make every effort to migrate to other
			formats, while keeping originals intact for reproducibility purposes (ie. migrated item will be a new
			repository record linked to the old). The guiding principles for format selection are: open standards are
			preferred over proprietary standards, formats should be well-documented, verifiable and proven,
			text-based formats are preferred over binary formats where possible, in the case of digitalization of analogue signal lossless or no compression is recommended.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the case of a withdrawal of funding, the repositories content would be transferred to another CLARIN
			centre.<!--While the legal aspects of the process of relocating data to another institution are underway the
			hosting institute (UFAL) offers a timeframe of at least 10 years, in which it will provide access to the
			data.-->
